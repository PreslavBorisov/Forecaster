Hi, in this project you can see diffrent folders.
I have divide the application by activities, adapters, dialogs and menus.

This application is created with idea for best user experience.

To go for source code go you have to went through this steps:
Forecaster/app/src/main/java/eu/example/forcaster/ after that there will be several folders 
i have created these for folders for easy navigatin through project there will be:
Activities where are main methods for each screen.
Adapters which adapters are for Recycle Viewes and spinneres in application
Dialogs there will be dialogs which i use in application.
FireBase there is the firebase code which i user for storing data and avoid data dublication.
Models there is data classes which is used for easier fetching data from firebase and represent objects line items in activities.
Utils is the folder where i use to store varilables which help me to navigate through application.
